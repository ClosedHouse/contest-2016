<p>Cool! Now you have the full control over the glados machine! Well. Almost. To finish your strike,
you should break into its inner structures and understand its character a bit. I'll advise
you that its core part is loaded as a kernel module. Try to find the module, debug it a bit
and obtain the last piece of information you need.</p>
<p>
You should aim to find glados core module, look at memory layout of this module and then debug it with gdb.

This level can be a little bit rought so don't hesitate and use hints. They are here for you, brave hacker.
