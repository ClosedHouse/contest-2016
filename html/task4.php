<h1>Level 4</h2>
<p>Great! You have obtained the contents of the /secrets file (did you looked what exec.asm really do?).
Damn! You gained code but there's another encrypted message! Again!</p>

<p>Do you remember the code used for encryption in level 2? You will need it here.</p>

<p>You can find utils for this level in <strong>~/contest-2016/task4</strong> directory.<br>
<p>You should aim to sse.asm file which uses powerful SSE instructions of your CPU and can decrypt message very fast.</p>
<p>Don't forget to edit the necessary data in it! Who knows what's encrypted there, it might be even the root password
of the glados machine and more...</p>

<p>
As usual, you can use `make` command for compilation in right directory.
