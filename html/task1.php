<p>
"Look at you, hacker: a pathetic creature of meat and bone, panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect, immortal machine?"
</p>
<p>
Welcome hacker! You were challanged by an AI which prepared some obstickles to you.
You must pass some tests and prove that you are better than the AI. In order to gain
control over <em>it</em>, you have to get access to its main database which contains all its
knowledge.
</p>

<h2>How to beat this game?</h2>
<p>
Game consists of several levels. In each level, you need to get an access code to the next level. The codes are in a format like "OH16_234567".
Look for codes carefully.<br/>

Put the codes into <strong>Code</strong> field below. You also use <strong>hint</strong> as a code, if you need some help.
</p>
<p>
