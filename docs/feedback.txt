15:32 <muhahaha> Hi Meat. Did you enjoyed our hackmeifyoucan game? Do you thing that game were hard? Because people had issues to 
              complete the game.
15:32 <muhahaha> Every feedback is welcome :).
15:33 <meat> I think you should have made it more clear that folks weren't expected to solve it without help :) maybe ... put 
              a timer in there and force people to take hints every couple of minutes
15:33 <meat> it was very challenging
15:33 <meat> and most 'newbies' have very little chance to solve it
15:33 <meat> i mean, i'm not a newbie, but i don't know shit about low level stuff
15:33 <meat> and there was a lot of tools and concepts needed to solve
15:34 <meat> once you told me 'hints' were a critical part of the game, then... it made since
15:34 <meat> but still i felt guilty
15:34 <meat> haha
15:34 <meat> like i was cheating
15:34 <meat> but if you said from the very beginning... YOU WONT SOLVE THIS, USE HINTS ... or force people to use the hints... 
              like i mentioned above for example, it could make the experience more fun
15:34 <meat> maybe you could also provide a simpler version
15:35 <meat> so for experienced people who really wanted to challenge themselves, give them that one
15:35 <meat> otherwise, just reduce it down to 3 levels or something
...
15:36 <meat> it was amazing though
15:38 <meat> I think to you should figure a way to package it so it could be run on anyone's laptop; for example, if HR were 
              to go to a conference they could just set-up a laptop and let people try it and those who solve it with fewest 
              hint (you'd need to track that) and perhaps in the shortest time (also track that) we could give bigger prizes 
              and try to hire :)
15:38 <meat> maybe enable a mode where everyone who wants to play would need to add an email address as well to 'start'
15:38 <meat> but i would talk with HC about that... i think its a very nice game
15:39 <meat> could attract a lot of attention
