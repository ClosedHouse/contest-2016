<p>Good. You are in next level!</p>
<p>Do you remember the magic number which was used as encryption code in the previous level? You should save this number for later use.</p>
<p>Well, how to deal with another Glados' challenge?</p>
<p>As an IT expert, you know very well that machines are usually not that perfect
as they seem to be... What if there's also some backdoor? Some narrow pipe, hidden
in the bushes behind the fortress...</p>

<p>You vaguely remember once there was a famous backdoor that was executing bytecode
received from an open network port. What if Glados suffers from it too? Anyway, a port
scan is always a good point to start.</p>

<p>Nmap is installed on your machine. You can use it.</p>

<p>After scan you may have a look at directory:<br>
~/contest-2016/task3/ and investigate the exec.asm file.
File contains remote exploit which will reveal some secrets to you.
You must compile this file and send it to the port you found.<br>
If you are really curios hacker, you should take a look at exec.asm file content.
