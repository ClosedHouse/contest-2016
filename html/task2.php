<p>Hmm, you successfully logged there and gained your first code. However, as neo, you cannot do so much with the
system. Feel free to log out of there, you don't want to compromise yourself in case your hacking fails.
You have to find out <strong>another way</strong> to become root there.<br/>Everyone wants to be root, that's an old unix truth.</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile you found a little assembly puzzle on your laptop. Try to play with it a bit,
maybe you can find some useful wisdom there... Always remember the codes and keys. You might need them later.
</p>

<p>
You can find your puzzle in directory:
<strong>~/contest-2016/task2</strong><br>

You should aim to decrypt.asm file. What happens here is not that important as a return code of the process.<br>Your shell is prepared for this situation so... don't hesitate and use this advantage!<br>
You can always compile this file by `make` command.
</p>
<p>Don't panic when you see some garbage on the screen. It will change as you will progress.</p>
