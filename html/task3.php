<p>Well, how to deal with Glados' challenge?</p>
<p>As an IT expert, you know very well that usually machines are not that perfect
as they seem to be... What if there's also some backdoor? Some narrow pipe, hidden
in the bushes behind the fortress...</p>

<p>You vaguely remember once there was a famous backdoor that was executing bytecode
received from an open network port. What if Glados suffers from it too? Anyway, a port
scan is always a good point to start.</p>

<p>After scan you may have a look at directory:<br>
~/contest-2016/task3/ and investigate the exec.asm file.
