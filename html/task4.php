<p>Great! You have obtained the contents of the /secrets file... Damn! it's encrypted again!</p>

<p>Let's use the shining power of the AI machine itself for decrypting it! Rather than torturing
your laptop's power efficient CPU...</p>

<p>Use the sse.asm file and try to force the AI machine to solve the problem for you. Don't forget
to edit the necessary data in it! Who knows what's encrypted there, it might be even the root password
of the machine...</p>

<p>
Craft the sse.asm file to make it decrypt the encrypted content and send it to the AI machine.
You find it again in <strong>~/contest-2016/asm</strong><br>
